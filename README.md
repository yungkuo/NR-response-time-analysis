# NR-response-time-analysis <br/>
Testing voltage-sensing NR's response time <br/>
532nm CW excitation; H33D detector <br/>
with fast voltage alternation at 100Hz and 1000Hz <br/>
Analysis involves ploting time traces from time stamps, wrap data to average, FFT of time trace to extract response frequency, FFT with sliding window
