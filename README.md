# NR-response-time-analysis <br/>
## Testing voltage-sensing NR's response time <br/>
### Hardware <br/>
532nm CW excitation <br/>
H33D detector <br/>
with fast voltage alternation at 100Hz and 1000Hz <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
### Analysis involves  <br/> 
ploting time traces from time stamps  <br/> 
wrap data to average  <br/> 
FFT of time trace to extract response frequency <br/>
FFT with sliding window
